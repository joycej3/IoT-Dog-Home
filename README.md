# The Dog House

## Introduction
This is the official GitLab repository for Group 13, a team of tech enthusiasts and innovators who love to explore the frontiers of software development, programming and Internet of Things. This repository showcases our group project and code snippets, demonstrating our expertise and creativity in the field of technology.

This project is for the module “CS7NS2 - Internet of Things” at Trinity College Dublin. For this project, we’ve used advanced hardware devices, such as the powerful ESP32 and ESP32-S2-Kaluga, the sensitive water sensor, the fun tilt sensor, weight sensor and the NFC sensor. We’ve also leveraged the capabilities of AWS IoT Core and ReactJs for our application.

Our team of software engineers has smartly integrated these components to create an innovative IoT solution that offers a smooth and user-friendly experience that feels like a harmony of technology. We’re passionate about our code quality and committed to delivering the best solutions to our clients and users.

## The IDEA
Pets are more than mere creatures; they are our steadfast companions, cuddly confidants, and valued members of our families. They deserve the best care and comfort we can provide, especially when we are away from home. However, balancing our busy schedules with our pets' needs can be challenging, such as feeding, playing, grooming, and training. That is why innovative home technology can be an excellent solution for pet owners who want to keep their pets safe, healthy, and happy.

Intelligent home devices for pets are gadgets that connect to the internet and allow us to remotely monitor, control, and interact with our pets. They can also automate some of the tasks we usually do for our pets, such as opening the door and dispensing food and water. Some of the smart home devices for pets that we have considered in our project are:


  Smart Collar: A wearable device fitted with NFC that tracks a pet’s location, activity, health, and behaviour.
  Dog Door: A door that opens and closes automatically for a pet using a sensor or an app or a smart collar.
  Food / Water Bowl: A bowl that measures and dispenses the right amount of food and water for a pet based on their calorie intake and hydration level.
  Video Call: A camera that lets the pet owner see and talk to their pet from anywhere using an app.
  Remote Controlled Ball Launcher / Treat Dispenser: A toy that launches balls or treats for a pet to chase and catch using an app.

These smart home devices can help enhance a pet's quality of life and the owner's peace of mind. They can also help the pet owner save time, money, and energy, by reducing the need for pet sitters and trainers.

The project has four parts: sensors and actuators, local communication, global communications and cloud application. The team comprised of five members: John, Gautam, Aditya, Vipul and Lucas (Shuncheng Cai). John handled the sensors and actuators part (hardware), Aditya and Vipul worked on the local communication, Gautam worked on global communications and the web application part of the cloud application, and Lucas worked on the machine learning part.
