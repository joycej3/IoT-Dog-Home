# The Dog House

## Introduction
This is the official GitLab repository for Group 13, a team of tech enthusiasts and innovators who love to explore the frontiers of software development, programming and Internet of Things. This repository showcases our group project and code snippets, demonstrating our expertise and creativity in the field of technology.

This project is for the module “CS7NS2 - Internet of Things” at Trinity College Dublin. For this project, we’ve used advanced hardware devices, such as the powerful ESP32 and ESP32-S2-Kaluga, the sensitive water sensor, the fun tilt sensor, weight sensor and the NFC sensor. We’ve also leveraged the capabilities of AWS IoT Core and ReactJs for our application.

Our team of software engineers has smartly integrated these components to create an innovative IoT solution that offers a smooth and user-friendly experience that feels like a harmony of technology. We’re passionate about our code quality and committed to delivering the best solutions to our clients and users.
